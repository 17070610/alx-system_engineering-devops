# Postmortem
This directory concerns about learning to write an incident report also known as postmortem. I have wrote a post mortem about a database outage, it talks in summary about the timeline, Rootcause, Resolutin and recovery and finally the Corrective and Preventative Measures.  
You can also follow these steps to write your own
## Issue Summary

* short summary (5 sentences)
* list the duration along with start and end times (include timezone)
* state the impact (most user requests resulted in 500 errors, at peak 100%)
* close with root cause

## Timeline

* list the timezone
* covers the outage duration
* when outage began
* when staff was notified
* actions, events, â€¦
* when service was restored

## Root Cause

* give a detailed explanation of event
* do not sugarcoat

## Resolution and recovery

* give detailed explanation of actions taken (includes times)

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

* itemized list of ways to prevent it from happening again
* what can we do better next time?
